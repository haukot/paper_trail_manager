# PaperTrailManager

Browse, subscribe, view and revert changes to records when using Ruby on Rails 3 and the `paper_trail` gem.

This software has been in use for a year at http://calagator.org and http://epdx.org. It works well. It has reasonable tests. However, it could definitely use more work.

## Installation

If you have a Ruby on Rails 3 or 4 application where you're using the `paper_trail` gem to track changes to your records, you can make use of this like:

Add the following line to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'paper_trail_manager'

PaperTrailManager will use your existing paging library ([will_paginate](https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate) or [Kaminari](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari)).  If you don't currently use one in your app, add one of the following lines to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'kaminari'
    #or
    gem 'will_paginate'

Install the libary:

    bundle install

Add the following line to your `config/routes.rb`:

    resources :changes, :controller => 'paper_trail_manager/changes'

Restart the server and go to the `/changes` URI to browse, subscribe, view and revert your changes. The top-level URL will look something like this:

    http://localhost:3000/changes

### Configuration

Several aspects of PaperTrailManager may be optionally configured
by creating an initializer in your application
(e.g. `config/initializers/paper_trail_manager.rb`).

To specify when reverts are allowed:

    PaperTrailManager.allow_revert_when do |controller, version|
      controller.current_user and controller.current_user.admin?
    end

To specify how to look up users/memebers/etc specified in Paper Trail's 'whodunnit' column:

    PaperTrailManager.whodunnit_class = User
    PaperTrailManager.whodunnit_name_method = :nicename   # defaults to :name

To specify a method to call to identify an item on an index page:

    PaperTrailManager.item_name_method = :nicename

And for linking (or not) to the user with a custom path helper:

    PaperTrailManager.user_path_method = :admin_path # defaults to :user_path
    PaperTrailManager.user_path_method = nil # no "show user" page in app

When including PaperTrailManager within another Rails engine, you may need to
override PaperTrailManager::ChangesController's parent class to reference the
engine's ApplicationController configure it to use your engine's url helpers:

    PaperTrailManager.base_controller = "MyEngine::ApplicationController"
    PaperTrailManager.route_helpers = MyEngine::Engine.routes.url_helpers

You can also specify the layout:

    PaperTrailManager.layout = 'my_engine/application'

### Localization

PaperTrailManager supports internationalization with built-in English and Russian translations. To use Russian:

    I18n.locale = :ru

Add new languages by creating YAML files in `config/locales/` following the structure in `config/locales/en.yml`.

## Development

Setup:

* Clone the repository
* Go into the directory
* Run `bundle` to install the development dependencies

Running tests:

* Run `appraisal rake` to run the tests against all supported gem combinations. Note that the first time tests are run, gems will need to be downloaded for each individual version of Rails this app is tested against, which may take a while.

Adding support for new Rails versions:

* This repo uses the [Appraisal](https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal) gem, to add a new rails version modify the Appraisals file
  - Add both a 'will_paginate' and a 'kaminari' version like so:
  ```
  appraise "rails-5.0-will-paginate" do
    gem "rails", "5.0.0"
    gem "will_paginate", "~> 3.0"
  end
  appraise "rails-5.0-will-kaminari" do
    gem "rails", "5.0.0"
    gem "kaminari", "~> 0.16"
  end
  ```
* Run `appraisal generate`
* Run `appraisal install`
* Fix whatever breaks.
* Please contribute your fixes with a Github pull request.
